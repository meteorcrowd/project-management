# project-management
Project management platform written with Meteor.js.

# Goal
The goal of this project is to produce a human-friendly project management and visualization platform. 

## Strategic partnerships
We would like to minimise duplication of effort by collaborating with, and building upon, existing projects from the Meteor.js community.

## Free/Open Source Software
This project is dedicated to improving the commonwealth. As such, all assets will be released under free/open culture licenses.

**Note:** There is currently an open issue to [choose the project sourcecode license](https://github.com/meteorcrowd/project-management/issues/2)
