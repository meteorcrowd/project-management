# project-management
Project management platform written with Meteor.js.

# Goal
The goal of this project is to produce a human-friendly project management and visualization platform. 

## Strategic partnerships
We would like to minimise duplication of effort by collaborating with, and building upon, existing projects from the Meteor.js community.

## Free/Open Source Software
This project is dedicated to improving the commonwealth. As such, all assets will be released under free/open culture licenses.

**Note:** There is currently an open issue to [choose the project sourcecode license](https://github.com/meteorcrowd/project-management/issues/2)

# Proposed features
The following features are currently under consideration:

* Projects - collaborative, or individual, ventures
* Tasks - the basic elements within projects
* Goals (or milestones) - big picture landmarks towards which we strive
* User Accounts - needed for authentication, ownership, etc
  * Profiles - demonstrating achievements, activity, affiliation, etc 
  * Groups - collecives with common abilities, ambitions, etc 
* Wiki documentation - collaborative documents
* Kanban board - visual representation of work in progress
  * Swimlanes - rows of tasks linked in common
* User Stories - encourage human-centered design/development
* Discussions - asynchronous (yet near real-time) focused discourse
